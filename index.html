        <h2>Meet Miracle Lawrence!</h2>
        <p>

            Hello, I'm Miracle Lawrence, a passionate educator, software development student, and aspiring tech-driven furniture innovator. With over five years of experience teaching mathematics, I have helped students build confidence and excel in their transitioning exams into high school.
            
            Beyond teaching, I have a strong interest in software development and have completed the PathwayConnect program as part of my journey toward a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Software Development. I also have experience in sales and marketing, having served as the Head of Sales/Marketing at OKUBOMARINE Waste Management Company.
            
            My passion for technology and innovation extends into furniture production, where I aspire to create high-quality, tech-integrated furniture solutions. Inspired by my elder brother's craftsmanship, I aim to take furniture design to the next level by incorporating smart technology.
            
            I believe in lifelong learning, creativity, and making a positive impact through education and technology. Let's connect and create something amazing together!

        <h2>Nigeria</h2>
        <img src="images/nigeria.jpeg" alt="A picture of the nigerian flag">
        <p>Nigeria, located in West Africa, is the most populous country on the continent. Its history dates back thousands of years, with ancient civilizations such as the Nok culture (around 1000 BC â€“ 300 AD) known for their advanced terracotta sculptures. Several powerful kingdoms and empires, including the Oyo Empire, Benin Kingdom, and Sokoto Caliphate, flourished in the region before European colonization.

            In the late 19th century, the British gradually took control, officially making Nigeria a British colony in 1914 through the amalgamation of the Northern and Southern Protectorates. Nigeria gained independence on October 1, 1960, but soon faced political instability, leading to a civil war (1967â€“1970) known as the Biafran War.
            
            Since then, Nigeria has experienced both military and civilian rule, eventually transitioning to democracy in 1999. Today, it remains a major economic and cultural powerhouse in Africa, rich in natural resources and home to diverse ethnic groups, languages, and traditions.
